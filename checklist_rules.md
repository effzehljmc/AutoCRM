When following a plan with a checklist follow these rules:
1.Checklist items should be in the form - [ ] {item}. When they are in progress, you should mark them as [PROGRESS] {item}. When they are finished, they should be marked [x] {item}.

2. Warnings should be put at the bottom of the checklist, and should include anything that you feel may impede our progress.

3. Testing should be emphasized in the checklist.

4. When test files reveal improvements or fixes, these MUST be backported to the original migration files to ensure both files handle edge cases consistently.
