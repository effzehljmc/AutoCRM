Checklist items should be in the form - [ ] {item}. When they are in progress, you should mark them as [PROGRESS] {item}. When they are finished, they should be marked [x] {item}.

Warnings should be put at the bottom of the checklist, and should include anything that you feel may impede our progress.

Testing should be emphasized in the checklist.
