# Project Specs – Revised (Standard Mindset, with GauntletAI Timelines & Testing)

## 1. Overview

**Project Name:** AI-Enhanced Helpdesk (Zendesk-Clone) with Drizzle  
**Description:**  
This project aims to build a helpdesk system inspired by Zendesk, using Vite (React + TypeScript) on the frontend, Supabase on the backend (database, auth, realtime), and Drizzle ORM for type-safe database interactions. The goal is to provide ticket management, user authentication, a knowledge base, reporting, and analytics—enriched with automated AI features such as ticket triage, suggested replies, and conversation summaries. The system's interface should be modern, flexible, and easy to maintain.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

1. **Streamlined Ticket Workflows**  
   Provide agents with a robust interface to manage, track, and resolve tickets using AI suggestions to speed resolution times.

2. **Scalable & Type-Safe Architecture**  
   Combine Supabase + Drizzle to ensure reliable schemas and strongly typed queries, boosting development productivity and lowering error rates.

3. **Seamless Auth Integration**  
   Couple Supabase Auth with a custom user table (via Drizzle) for advanced relationship handling (profiles, roles).

4. **Modern UI/UX**  
   Leverage shadcn/ui and Lucid to offer a high-quality experience for agents and end-users.

5. **Effective Knowledge Sharing**  
   Maintain a searchable knowledge base, with the option for both public and private articles, feedback loops, and real-time updates.

## 6. Technical Implementation

### 6.1 Frontend (Vite + React)

- **React + TypeScript** for a quick, modular front-end.  
- **shadcn/ui** and Lucid for cohesive design components.

### 6.2 Supabase & Drizzle Integration

- **Supabase**  
  - PostgreSQL database hosting, Auth management (auth.users), realtime event broadcasting.

  - Type-safe migrations and queries for `tickets`, `profiles`, `kb_articles`.  

### 6.3 Linking Supabase Auth & Drizzle

1. **`auth.users` Table**  
   - Supabase's built-in table remains the primary Auth layer.

2. **Profiles Table**  
   - A custom Drizzle-managed table in `public` referencing user IDs from `auth.users`.  
   - Use triggers to populate `profiles` automatically when new users register.

3. **Environment & RLS**  
   - Access Drizzle code in server contexts (serverless or Node environment).  
   - Configure Row-Level Security in Supabase for added data protection.

### 6.4 AI Features

1. **OpenAI or Similar Provider**  
   - Triage or classification logic for new tickets.  
   - Summaries or reply suggestions.  

2. **Implementation Approach**  
   - Expose serverless endpoints (e.g., Supabase Edge Functions or AWS Lambda) that call AI providers.  
   - The front-end interacts with these endpoints, keeping API keys secure.

### 6.5 Deployment

1. **AWS Amplify**  
   - Hosts the static React app.  
   - Enables environment variables for connecting Supabase and AI services.  

2. **CI/CD**
