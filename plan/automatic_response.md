Below is an outline for guiding users towards relevant FAQs from your knowledge base before they create a new ticket, along with a simplified code example demonstrating the concept. By showing potentially helpful articles, you reduce the number of tickets for issues already covered by existing documentation. If the user still needs human assistance, they can proceed to submit a ticket.

---

## 1. Gather User Input Early

• When the user clicks "Create Ticket," use the description and title of the ticket.  
• Use this to query relevant kb_articles via embedding.

Example (pseudo) flow:
1. customer enters information I forgot my password.
2. System automatically looks up knowledge base articles that match "reset password" keywords or embeddings.  
3. Show the matching FAQs or articles to the user.

This approach allows them to self-service if the article solves their issue.

---

## 2. Display Search Results in a Modal or Inline

Below is a simple React snippet demonstrating how you might show relevant articles when a user starts creating a ticket. This code:  
• Captures the user's subject input.  
• Calls a findRelevantArticles function (stands in for your actual search logic).  
• Displays matching kb_articles.  
• If the user is satisfied, they no longer need to create a ticket. Otherwise, they can proceed.

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { findRelevantArticles } from '@/lib/kb'; // Imaginary utility

export function NewTicketFlow() {
  const [subject, setSubject] = useState('');
  const [suggestedArticles, setSuggestedArticles] = useState<any[]>([]);
  const [stage, setStage] = useState<'searching'|'results'|'createTicket'>('searching');

  // Call this whenever the subject changes, e.g., debounced
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!subject || subject.length < 3) {
      setSuggestedArticles([]);
      return;
    }

    // Example function that calls your knowledge base search
    findRelevantArticles(subject).then((articles) => {
      setSuggestedArticles(articles || []);
      setStage('results');
    });
  }, [subject]);

  const handleProceedToTicket = () => {
    setStage('createTicket');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {stage !== 'createTicket' && (
        <div>
          <h2>Need help? Let's see if we have something that can solve your issue immediately.</h2>
          <label htmlFor="subject">Briefly describe your issue:</label>
          <input
            id="subject"
            type="text"
            value={subject}
            onChange={(e) => setSubject(e.target.value)}
          />
        </div>
      )}

      {stage === 'results' && suggestedArticles.length > 0 && (
        <div>
          <h3>We found some articles that might help:</h3>
          <ul>
            {suggestedArticles.map((article) => (
              <li key={article.id}>
                <a href={`/kb/${article.id}`} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
                  {article.title}
                </a>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
          <p>Still need help?</p>
          <button onClick={handleProceedToTicket}>Continue to Create Ticket</button>
        </div>
      )}

      {stage === 'results' && suggestedArticles.length === 0 && subject.length >= 3 && (
        <div>
          <p>No articles found. You can continue to create a new ticket.</p>
          <button onClick={handleProceedToTicket}>Create Ticket</button>
        </div>
      )}

      {stage === 'createTicket' && (
        <div>
          <h2>Create a New Ticket</h2>
          {/* Ticket creation form goes here */}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 3. Searching kb_articles

Below is a placeholder function that could call your Supabase RAG function or a simple text-based search. Adapt it to your actual retrieval logic:

```typescript
// src/lib/kb.ts (pseudo-code)
export async function findRelevantArticles(query: string) {
  // You could call an RPC that performs an embedding-based search:
  // return supabase.rpc('match_kb_articles', { query_embedding, match_threshold, match_count });

  // For simplicity, this snippet just does a naive full-text search
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('kb_articles')
    .select('*')
    .textSearch('content', query);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error searching articles:', error.message);
    return [];
  }

  return data || [];
}
```

---

## 4. User Decides Next Steps

• If the displayed kb_articles solve their problem, they won't need a ticket.  
• Otherwise, they can click "Continue to Create Ticket."  
• This step reduces ticket volume for common questions (e.g., how to reset password, how to change subscription, etc.).

---

## 5. Integrate with Existing RAG or FAQ Modules

If you already have a RAG-based recommendation system, simply modify the search snippet to incorporate embeddings and similarity search. By reusing your existing kb_articles and embedding logic, you can quickly provide relevant FAQs. The user can then opt out of creating a new ticket if articles answer their questions.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements

• Provide immediate feedback on article helpfulness (thumbs up/down).  
• Log when a user proceeds to create a ticket after reviewing an article, to identify knowledge gaps.  
• A/B test different suggestion UI placements to find which design yields the most self-serve resolutions.

---

By querying the FAQs during ticket creation, you empower users to self-resolve quickly, reduce repetitive support tasks, and maintain a smoother overall experience.

### Granular Step-by-Step Plan for Showing Relevant Articles Before Creating a Ticket

Below is a more detailed plan expanding on the original high-level outline. It demonstrates how to guide users toward relevant FAQs (kb_articles) before finalizing a new ticket. By presenting helpful articles early, you aim to reduce repetitive tickets for issues already answered in your Knowledge Base.

---

### 1. Capture User Input (Ticket Subject & Description)

1. Provide a preliminary input form (e.g., "New Ticket" dialog) that captures:
   - A short subject line (e.g., "Reset Password Issue").
   - An optional longer description where the user can detail their problem.

2. Introduce event listeners or hooks (e.g., React useEffect) to detect changes in the subject field.  
   - A threshold can be set (e.g., ≥ 3 characters) before triggering a KB search.

3. (Optional) Debounce the search requests so you don't spam your backend on every keystroke.

---

### 2. Perform a Knowledge Base Search

1. Create or reuse a function (e.g., findRelevantArticles) that searches kb_articles.  
   - This can be full-text search, embedding-based (RAG), or both.  
   - For embeddings, call a Supabase RPC like match_kb_articles or run a pgvector search.

2. Pass the user's subject (or description) as the query to your knowledge base search function.

3. On the backend (or in a serverless function), handle logic such as:
   - Constructing a text search query on kb_articles.content.  
   - Checking your embeddings column if you're using pgvector.  
   - Combining semantic search with filters (e.g. "public" articles only).

Example (no line numbers):
```typescript
// src/lib/kb.ts
export async function findRelevantArticles(query: string) {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('kb_articles')
    .select('*')
    .textSearch('content', query);

  if (error) {
    console.error('Error searching kb_articles:', error.message);
    return [];
  }
  return data || [];
}
```

---

### 3. Display Potentially Helpful Articles

1. When the system returns articles, show them in a results list within the ticket creation flow.  
   - This could be in a dropdown, a modal, or an inline panel.

2. For each search result:
   - Highlight the article title and a brief description or excerpt.  
   - Provide a link to open the full article in a new tab or inline viewer.

3. If results are empty (and the user typed at least 3 characters), display a message indicating "No articles found. Feel free to create a new ticket."

---

### 4. Let the User Choose Next Steps

1. If the user finds a relevant FAQ that solves their problem:
   - Offer a button or link (e.g. "Mark as Resolved" or "Issue Solved") so they can skip creating a ticket.

2. If they still need help:
   - Provide a "Continue to Create Ticket" button.

3. Once the user clicks "Continue to Create Ticket," expand the form to capture:
   - More details (if not already provided).  
   - Priority, attachments, category tags, etc.  
   - Then finalize ticket creation by calling your createTicket logic.

---

### 5. Integrate with RAG or FAQ Modules

1. If you already have an AI-based RAG system:
   - Replace the simple textSearch call with an RPC that uses embeddings to find more contextually relevant FAQs.  
   - You might also summarize the user's query and generate an "answer preview" directly.  

2. Cache or store the recommended articles to pair them with the new ticket if the user decides to continue.  
   - This helps support staff see what articles the user already tried.

---

### 6. Future Enhancements

1. Feedback Loop:
   - Let the user rate the recommended article as "Helpful" or "Not Helpful."  
   - Store feedback in article_views for improved personalization.

2. A/B Testing:
   - Experiment with different ways of presenting the suggestions (modal vs inline vs separate page).  
   - Track which approach leads to higher self-service resolutions.

3. Analytics & Insights:
   - Log how many times articles are displayed vs how often a user still creates a ticket.  
   - Identify where your KB might need more content (if many queries return zero/irrelevant results).

4. Additional Channels:
   - Extend the same approach to your Chat or Email ingestion process—automatically reply with helpful articles before sending the ticket to an agent.

---

### Conclusion

By following these more granular steps to capture user input, search the knowledge base, and optionally skip ticket creation, you reduce repetitive questions and enhance the user experience. If the user still needs direct assistance, they can easily finalize ticket creation after reviewing possible solutions.
